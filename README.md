# goober2D

goober2D, or goober, is a personal project initiated to streamline the process of maintaining HTML visuals.
This tool aims to provide an intuitive interface for users, making it easier to create, manage, and preview HTML content.
Whether you're a web designer, developer, or just starting with HTML, goober2D strives to simplify the intricacies of web development.

### User-Intuitive Interface
goober2D is designed with the user in mind, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The user interface is intuitive, allowing both beginners and experienced developers to interact seamlessly with HTML content. The goal is to provide a visual representation of HTML elements and their styling, minimizing the need for users to dive into intricate code structures.

### Real-Time Previews
goober2D enables users to preview their HTML content in real-time. The preview window allows instant visualization of how the webpage will appear to end-users. This immediate feedback loop empowers users to make quick adjustments, enhancing the efficiency of the development process, unlike traditional HTML.

### Minimal Learning Curve
Instead of learning HTML's syntax, all the user will have to do is interact with the basic user interface.
Users will be able to edit elements of the webpage, without needing CSS.

### Expansive Capabilities
goober2D allows users to interact with JavaScript, opening possibilities to dynamic web-development. 
This is optional, but is recommended to use, since JavaScript is very powerful.

goober2D still removes the need for HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is dynamically implemented to open up capability, and not limit the user.
